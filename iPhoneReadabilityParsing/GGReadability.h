 GGReadability was originally based on the open source JS readability code.
 Since then I have changed how this works so it does the follow :
    - Convert all line breaks and br tags to p tags so we can search better
    - If parsed a hint, score up the element based on wether it matches the hint parsed in
    - Scores up elements based on image size within them
    - Scores up elements based on size of embeds inside them
    - Scores up elements on puncation, number of words, how many paragraphs they have and if they contain lists or headers
    - Scores up elements on same principle readabilty did with checking class and id's against certain key words
    - Scores up elements on wether they use the HTML5 article or section tag names
    - Marks down on forms, inputs and any other stuff thats not normally inside articles
    - Marks down on same principle readabily uses with checking class and id's against certain key words
 Once the element has been found, its then cleaned from any unwanted elements, such as unwanted divs etc then replaces p tags
 we have injected back with br tags, then removes duplicate br tags if they are next to each other.
